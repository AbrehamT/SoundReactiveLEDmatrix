# Sound Reactive LED Matrix

This project contains the code for programming the ESP32-A1S audiokit board to recieve audio input from its builtin
mic and display its input as LED lights on an LED matrix through the use of the FFT algorithm. 
This code heavily relies on and is a tweak on  https://github.com/pschatzmann's audio-tools library.
